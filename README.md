## Computational Elucidation of Protein-Protein Interactions in JCVI-syn3A
Contributors: Arnav Meduri, Abhinav Meduri

### Overview
Minimal cells are fundamentally interesting in the context of studying abiogenesis and cellular engineering. This project uses the sequences of individual proteins in the cell to infer higher-level organization of those proteins into protein complexes. By comparing large collections of proteins, we identified correlations and used them to infer not only which proteins interact, but also the specific locations on the proteins where the interactions occur.

### Mycoplasma mycoides JCVI-syn3A
Mycoplasma mycoides is a bacterium that lacks a cell wall and is considered to possess the smallest genome of a free living organism. It can be grown in a chemically defined synthetic medium. In nature, it is a minor pathogen. It was the second cellular genome to be sequenced. The same group that sequenced it later made it the first genome to be completely resynthesized and booted up as a living cell. Later, the group did extensive work to identify  non-essential genes (genes that could be removed and still have a living cell). The final version of the genome from this systematic reduction process is JCVI-Syn3A.
